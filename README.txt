Problem:
Data Parsing

Hi and thanks for taking the time to read my code.  This is my solution to the Data Parsing Code Homework.


Execution
1) The site is hosted on firebase and can be accessed by going to this address:  https://data-parser-27a4b.web.app/
2) Paste the data into the text area that says "Paste data here!".
3) Type search keyword into the next line below that says "Type search here!".  The search operates only one word at a time and is NOT case sensative.
4) Click the Go! button to find results.
